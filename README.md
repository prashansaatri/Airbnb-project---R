Airbnb has appealed to hosts around the world who are looking to make a steady profit off their listings. In return, the platform continues to grow and expand its network to reach a greater audience. This creates a dependable union between the two and presents an inviting opportunity to anyone who may want to become a host soon.

Questions
To better understand the market, a potential host may seek answers to the following questions: 
1) Where are the cheapest and most expensive neighborhoods to rent an Airbnb in Denver?
2) The potential host has purchased a property on Zillow and wants to rent it out via Airbnb. How
much should they charge per night to rent this property? Is there anything that should be
highlighted in the listing?
3) Can we find a better property in Denver to purchase as a short-term rental? Are some
neighborhoods better than others for buying a short-term rental?


Findings
1) Based on our findings, the cheapest neighborhood to rent an Airbnb in Denver is Southmoor Park,
while the most expensive neighborhood to rent is in Wellshire.
2) While solving the answer to this question, we looked at which option would be the most
profitable: to rent the entire Airbnb to one guest at a time, or to rent out private rooms to several
guests during an allotted time frame. If the host were to rent the entire property to one individual
at a time, the property should be listed at around $314.17 a night, to maximize profits and
compete with other listings in the same location. Alternatively, the host can rent an individual
room in the property for an average of $109.32 a night per room.
3) Regarding short-term rentals, our analysis found that three neighborhoods proved to be ideal for
renting in. University Park, Belcaro, and Washington Park West were amongst the top
neighborhoods that housed the most short-term rentals and were voted by consumers to be in
the best locations.
